HashMap:
       It implements Map interface, based on key and value pair it get stored.
       It has unique key , can store only one null key and multiple values.
       Insertion order is not maintained,non-synchronised.
       When we try to implement a duplicate key , the value of the key will be updated.
       The only difference between HashSet and HashMap is hashSet can store only value but hashMap can store key and value.
       It is useful for searching, deleting,updating operations.
Linked HashMap:
       It is same as the hashMap , the only difference is it maintains insertion order
       whereas hashmap doesn't maintain insertion order.
TreeMap:
      It is based on red-black tree(i.e. ascending order)
      It has unique keys,no null keys are stored, but multiple null values can be stored,non synchronized.
