Types:
     Built-in package:There are many packages which is in the java like util,lang,io,etc. we can make use of it by using import keyword.
     User defined package:In addition to built-in package we can also create some packages when we need . For creating new packages java uses file directory system as like a folder in computer.
     Save the file as classname.java
     Compile it as:C:\sources>javac classname.java
     Run it as:c:\sources>java package name.classname
Importing:
        import package name.* - this will import all the classes and interfaces of this package
        import package name.classname - this will import declared class of this package
        fully qualified name - in this no need of importing any package but want to access everytime when we need the class in that package.
                               importing syntax:package name.classname object = new package name.classname();
