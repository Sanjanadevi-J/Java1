Wrapper class:
         It provides a mechanism to convert primitive data type into object of a class and object into data types.
         Wrapper class is a class which wraps(encloses) around the data type and gies it as an object.
         when we need a data type as an object in the program we can make use of it.
         It is available in java.util package.
         When unwrapping takes place(i.e) converting object to data type it requires methods.
Application:
         Autoboxing: converting data type into object - here constructor is used
         Unboxing(unwrap): converting object into data type, we have to assign the value of object to a new variable.
         Converting string into data type, this is also called parsing operation- here parse method is used.
Advantage:
         We can store null value to the wrapper class.
         Sometimes, we need to use object instead of datatype. when working with collection framework.
