Exception handling:
         It is a mechanism to handle runtime errors
         Exception will disturbs the normal flow of the program to avoid it exception handling is used.

Types:
     checked exception- compile time exception like IO exception
     unchecked exception- runtime exception like arithmetic exception,array out of index,null pointer
     error- errors are irrecoverable like syntax error, out of memory.
Keywords used in exception handling:
      try- it is block where we can write in which we are excepting the exception.
      catch- it will handle the exception raised in try.
      throw- it describes the error or a message about what the error is.
      throws- gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception
      finally- finally will be executed at last whether the exception is handled or not
Advantage:
      it separates error code
      helps to maintain flow of code
      Differentiates the error
