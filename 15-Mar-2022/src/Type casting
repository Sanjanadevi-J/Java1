Type casting:
            It is a method or a process that converts a data type into another data type.
            It will done automatically by the compiler and manually by the programmer.
Types:
      Narrowing(manual method): converting higher order data type to lower order data type.
                                explicit conversion.
                                syntax: target_datatype variable = (target_datatype) source_data_variable;
      Widening(automatic conversion):converting lower to higher order data type.
                                     implicit conversion and safer.
                                     Condition:
                                            Both data type must be compatible with each other.
                                            Target type must larger than source type.
                                            Character type will not be able to convert because char is not compatible with the integral data types
