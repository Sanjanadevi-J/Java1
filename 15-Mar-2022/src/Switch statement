Switch statement:
             switch statement is one condition with multiple statement. It is like if else ladder.
             It will check the equality of a variable.
             We can use break statement to exit the code once the condition is reach but it is not mandatory to use it.
             If we not use break statement it will print the reached condition and the remaining followed cases.
             In switch statement one case is independent of other so it will execute with minimum time.
             If all the cases are false it will print the default case in the switch statement.
Break statement:
            If the condition is reached it came out of the loop and will not print the reached condition also.
            break statement is used in all the loops.
Continue statement:
            If the condition is reached it will not execute the current iteration and jump to the next iteration and print the remaining iteration.
            It will applicable in all the loops .
