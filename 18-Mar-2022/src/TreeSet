      TreeSet(Comparator<?super E>comparator)-builds an empty TreeSet and sorted according to the user.
      TreeSe(SortedSet<E>s)-builds TreeSet with the elements of given sorted set.
Methods:

    descendingIterator(prints element in descending order),descendingSet(prints reverse order),
    headSet(group of element less than given element),higher,lower,pollFirst,pollLast,subset.tailSet,spliterator,
    contains,empty,clear,clone,size,first,last.
