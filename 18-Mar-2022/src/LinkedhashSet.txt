LinkedHashSet:
      It is class in HashSet,it is derived class of HashSet.
      It does not store any duplicate element,it maintains insertion order and permits null value to store,non-synchronized.
Constructors:
     LinkedHashSet(int capacity)- initialize linked list with given capacity.
     LinkedHashSet(int capacity,float fillRatio)-initialize capacity and load capacity from set argument.

*note:the only difference between Hashset and LinkedHashSet is HashSet doesn't follow insertion order where LinkedHashSet follows.
