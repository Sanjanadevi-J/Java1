String:
       String is a collection of sequence of character. String is a class which is imported by using import java.lang package.
       It is immutable (i.e) we can't modify the string in the same memory location.
       Memory for a string is allocated in constant pool.(if the object name is different but the content is same it wil allocate single memory space.)
       There are many methods in the string which is inbuilt.
Disadvantage:
       String class are immutable. so, it is modified in new memory location.
       It requires more memory space.
By making use of StringBuffer ans=d StringBuilder we can avoid this problem.
StringBuffer and StringBuilder:
       It is mutable.
       we can make changes in the string in same location.
       we can modify the string using StringBuffer and StringBuilder.
       The memory will be allocated in heap memory.
